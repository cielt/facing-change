# Facing Change :hourglass_not_done:

Facing Change is a photo book calling attention to climate change and solutions in NYC. This is a standalone instance of the piece published on 350Brooklyn's [Parts Per Million](https://ppm.350brooklyn.org/photo-books/facing-change/). It is bootstrapped with the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) vanilla project template and features the [Climate Clock widget](https://github.com/climateclock/climate-clock-widget).

## Getting Started

### You&rsquo;ll need

- Node.js runtime - [More about Node here](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - [**npm**](<(https://www.npmjs.com/)>) package manager (comes bundled with Node.js) or
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version control utility
- Terminal
- Text editor

### For Development

1. [Clone](https://github.com/cielt/facing-change) (or download) the project files.

```
git clone https://github.com/cielt/facing-change.git
cd facing-change
```

2. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Test your development instance

```
npm run dev
```

Load the site at `http://localhost:5173/`

### For Production

4. Generate an optimized build. To configure your production instance, please see [Vite's guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) on build and deploy options. If you plan to host your site under a nested path, please take care to [configure your build](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#public-base-path) accordingly.

```
npm run build
```

You can preview the build locally by running

```
npm run preview
```

5. Deploy your site (detailed info on options from [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)) :party_popper:
